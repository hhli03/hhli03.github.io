        <p>Loneliness smells like a foul odor<br>
        from the withering flowers and rotting stems.<br>
        I’m isolated in the vase,<br>
        sucked up by my tears from sleepless nights.<br>
        I got no one to lay my head on because all of them are dried up.<br>
       Their heads dropped down, their stems falling apart.<br>
        Their once-so-sweet scent<br>
        are fading away like the specs of dust<br>
        disappearing into the air<br>
        The only thing I have left is the water<br>
        that’s never been changed,<br>
        smelling like rotten sewage and dirt.<br>
        Even the dried-up tulip petals<br>
        are blown away from me.<br>
        Sadly lying there on the edge of the table<br>
        With a musty odor that’s disappearing day by day.<br></p>
    </div>
    <div id="text2">Loneliness smells like an abandoned field<br>
        out in the dark, a blank void.<br>
        The smell of dried bushes and hay<br>
        that could crumble down in one touch,<br>
        and the coarse grass that's left unrecognizable<br>
        in the soil without any moisture.<br>
        It doesn't smell like the evening rain<br>
        that's sweet and pleasant anymore.<br>
        I'm out of place, covered up with a pungent dry, powdery scnet<br>
        from the dust that's melting me away,<br>
        leaving an uncomfortable tingle on my nose.<br>
        Without all of the fresh, clean floral scents<br>
        of daisies and fresh-cut grass,<br>
        the world seems to be in black and white.<br>
        Everything smells like nothingness<br>
        with a stale and damp scent that lingers in the air.<br>

    <div id="text3">Loneliness smells like a cold winter night.<br>
        It is snowing outside, the temperature's cooling down,<br>
        The empty bedroom I'm in smells like a hospital,<br>
        unpleasant, bitter, and artificial.<br>
        The waxy white walls are engulfing me,<br>
        making me suffocate in silence.<br>
        On this numbing night,<br>
        my soul hunger for home.<br>
        Home is a scent that warms my soul, home is my blanket.<br>
        I breathe in my blanket deeply, inhaling its scent.<br>
        It smells like a soft, clean cashmere sweater<br>
        sprayed with the perfume from yesterday<br>
        that's sweet, woody and smoky.<br>
        A comforting scent that stays by my side when I'm alone<br>
        A reassuring scent that stops me<br>
        from shivering like a leaf in the wind.<br>

    </div>
    <div id="text4">Loneliness smells like summer rain.<br>
        As winds pick up and clouds roll in,<br>
        there's a sweet, pungent zing in my nostrils.<br>
        I'm wandering in the shadows,<br>
        trying to knock on your damp, moldy window.<br>
        Wishing you would notice my existence,<br>
        wishing you would ask me how I'm doing, but you never did.<br>
        I slowly drip down your window<br>
        and landed on a blue umbrella,<br>
        A smell reminiscence of powdery cucumbers and dry soil.<br>
        A distinctive scent that accompanies the first rain<br>
        after a long, warm, dry spell.<br>
       The closer I got to grey cement, the duller the scent became.<br>
        Fast cars driving down the road and shaking the ground<br>
        People stepping on me like I'm a nonexistent being.<br>
        The smell of isolation,
        The smell of a cold, colorless world.<br>

    <div id="text5">Loneliness smells like a children's toy shop<br>
        The sweet fragrance of strawberry, bubble gum, cotton candy<br>
        that's appealing to many kids.<br>
        I was placed at the back of the shelves<br>
        and squeezed into a small space<br>
        together with other plastic toys that smell like new paint.<br>
        No one took a glimpse at me even once<br>
        because I was always blocked by the <br>
        new-released fluffy plushies<br>
        that have an addictive vanilla and coconut scent.<br>
        Every time someone enters the store,<br>
        I pray that they will bring me home, but they never did.<br>
        Later on, I was no longer on display.<br>
        but was thrown in the pitch-black storage room<br>
        that smells like a deserted island.<br>
        A room piled with dust,<br>
        filled with useless plastic packaging,<br>
        and unwanted, lonely toys like me.<br>  
    </div>
    <div id="text6">Loneliness smells like a crowded room<br>
        full of people whom I don't know.<br>
        A mixture of odd scents from all of the strangers.<br>
        Cigarettes and booze.<br>
        Peppermint and oversprayed perfume.<br>
        Crisp snow and coffee.<br>
        Leather and incense.<br>
        All of them drifting through the congested space.<br>
        Though I'm surrounded by people<br>
        who are chatting contentedly with each other<br>
        I feel lonely. I feel like I do not belong here.<br>
        The unfamiliar scents are overwhelming me,<br>
        making my head spin.<br>
        As if all of the scents are exploding<br>
        like fire swirls in slow motion.<br>
        I just want to escape from this unfamiliarity and loneliness.<br>
