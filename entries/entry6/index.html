A variety of scents waft through the streets,
from fish balls and beef brisket from the street stalls
to the exhaust gases from vehicles.
The smell of people smoking cigarettes
as well the smell of freshly made egg waffles.
The memories of hot summer days in Hong Kong,
the clutter, and the humidity.
You can smell the heat from the sun,
and the sweat from the crowds of people.</textarea>

The autumn days in parks,
the smell of fallen leaves,
damp moss, wet tree trunks.
The moist breeze after the rain.
As I walked through the park,
I smell the grass and flower buds.
Generally, a fresh and pleasant scent
that is relaxing and calming.
But of course,
there's always a distinctive smell
from the dog poop, weeds, and garbages
that creeps in.</textarea>

I remember sitting on a bench
at the seaside in Hong Kong,
the smell of the salty ocean and the cold sun.
It's a simple smell but at the same time,
it smells immense and unique.
As I lay down and look at the broad sky,
the air smells pure and pleasant.
--
I remember walking down the road
and through the tunnel.
The echoing smell of nothingness.
A hardly noticeable scent,
a delicate scent that I can't quite describe.
My perception was blocked by the crowds and the city odors.
A whiff of a magnificent scent appears
but then it vanishes all at once.
--
As I breathe again, my worries all dissolved.
There is a sweet, pungent zing in my nostrils
as everything blended,
and created this memory in my mind
which reminds me of home.</textarea>

Walking down the streets in NYC,
sometimes,
it smells like garbage and sweat,
the hard-to-classify odors
that come blasting on waves of hot air out of
subway grates and building vents.
--
Sometimes,
it smells like 
cigarettes, smoke, and exhaust.
Together with the smell of food stalls,
the meat frying on a flattop grill.
--
Sometimes,
it smells like warm coffee and vanilla
or baked bread fresh out of the oven
from all of the stalls and cafes
in the wintertime.
--
Sometimes,
it smells like perfume,
the wafts of perfumed air ejected from
the revolving doors on 5th Avenue
--
Sometimes,
it smells like fumes
from buses and trucks,
the vehicular exhaust from all the car traffic.
--
Sometimes,
it smells like a salty sea
when the tide has come in
and the wind is just right.</textarea>
